The viewer integrates seamlessly with VR platforms and supports dynamic video switching and interactive user controls.

## Features

- **360-Degree Video Playback**: Experience high-definition 360-degree videos with smooth playback controls.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Scrollable UI with buttons to easily switch between videos.
- **Dynamic Fade Effects**: Enjoy seamless transitions between videos with fade-in and fade-out effects.
- **VR Optimization**: Enhanced for VR headsets, ensuring a comfortable and engaging viewing experience.
- **Performance Metrics**: Designed to maintain optimal performance and stability across different VR platforms.

## Getting Started

### Setup Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**
   - **Create and Configure GameObject**: Create an empty GameObject in Unity (e.g., `VideoManager`) and attach the `VideoManager360` script to it.
   - **Video Materials**: Prepare materials for each video you want to display. Assign these materials to the `videoMaterials` array in the Inspector.
   - **VideoPlayer Component**: Add a `VideoPlayer` component to the GameObject and configure it to handle your video playback.

2. **Assign UI Buttons**
   - **UI Buttons Setup**: Add UI buttons to your ScrollView in the scene.
   - **Link Buttons to Script**: Drag and drop each button into the `Buttons` array field of the `VideoManager360` script. Ensure each buttonâ€™s `OnClick` event is linked to the `SetSelectedVideoIndex` method with the correct index.

3. **Configure Fade Canvas**
   - **Fade Canvas**: Ensure that the `FadeCanvas` component is correctly referenced in the `VideoManager360` script. This component should handle fade-in and fade-out effects.

4. **Build Settings**
   - **Platform Selection**: Go to `File > Build Settings` and select the appropriate platform (e.g., Windows, Android, iOS, VR).
   - **Scenes Management**: Add all necessary scenes to the build.
   - **Player Settings**: Configure player settings for VR, including resolution, aspect ratio, and VR-specific settings.

### Usage

- **Start Video Playback**: Click on a button in the ScrollView to select and start a video. The application will handle the fade transition and start playback.
- **Pause Video**: Use the provided controls to pause the video, which will include a fade-out effect.

### Known Issues

- **UI Scaling in VR**: UI elements may need adjustment for different VR environments to ensure proper scaling and positioning.
- **Video Playback Performance**: Performance may vary based on hardware; ensure to test on different VR setups.

## Testing Results

### Performance

- **Frame Rate**: The application consistently maintains a frame rate of 90 FPS, providing a smooth viewing experience.
- **Resource Usage**: Monitored CPU and GPU usage remain within acceptable limits, ensuring optimal performance.

### Stability

- **Crash Reports**: No crashes were observed during extensive testing phases.
- **Freeze Instances**: Transitions between videos and UI interactions are smooth with no freezes.

### User Experience

- **UI Interaction**: All UI elements function as intended in VR, with buttons responding accurately to user input.
- **Ease of Navigation**: Users can easily navigate through the UI and select videos, with clear visual feedback during transitions.

## Development Process

### Initial Setup

- **Environment Configuration**: Set up the Unity environment with the necessary components, including video materials, UI elements, and VR settings.
- **Script Implementation**: Developed and tested the `VideoManager360` script to handle video playback, UI interaction, and fade effects.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Integrating VR-specific controls and ensuring smooth performance across various VR platforms.
  - **Solution**: Optimized the script for VR and tested on multiple headsets to ensure compatibility.

- **Challenge**: Achieving smooth fade effects and transitions without impacting performance.
  - **Solution**: Fine-tuned the fade durations and ensured that video materials and fade canvas were efficiently managed.
