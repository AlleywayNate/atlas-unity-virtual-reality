# Atlas Unity Virtual Reality Assignments

This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects completed as part of my coursework at Atlas College, focusing on Unity and virtual reality (VR) development. Each project explores different aspects of VR development, including physics interaction, accessibility, and 360 video experiences.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **360-Video**
   - **Status:** Broken and being replaced.
   - **Description:** Initial attempts at creating an immersive 360-video experience in Unity. Currently under revision for better implementation.

### 2. **ReadyPlayerMe_BodyTracking**
   - **Status:** Functional.
   - **Description:** Integrated ReadyPlayerMe avatars with body tracking to enhance VR interactions. Focused on combining avatar customization with immersive body tracking.

### 3. **Intro-to-VR**
   - **Status:** Updated.
   - **Description:** Introductory project exploring the basics of VR development in Unity. Includes examples of teleportation, interaction, and spatial awareness.

### 4. **Physics-Interaction**
   - **Status:** Updated.
   - **Description:** Focused on simulating realistic physics interactions in a VR environment. Includes object grabbing, throwing, and collision mechanics.

### 5. **Pose-Emote**
   - **Status:** Under revision.
   - **Description:** Developed a pose and emote system for VR, using SteamVR for hand tracking. Current work involves addressing bugs related to file location changes.

### 6. **Unity-AR_Slingshot_Game**
   - **Status:** Ongoing.
   - **Description:** A mobile AR game featuring a slingshot mechanic to hit moving targets. Integrates AR plane detection, responsive UI, and dynamic gameplay.

### 7. **Accessibility**
   - **Status:** Ongoing.
   - **Description:** Investigating VR accessibility features to make games more inclusive. Includes experiments with UI scaling, voice controls, and simplified interactions.

## Goals and Learnings

- **Exploration of VR Technologies:** Gaining hands-on experience with Unityâ€™s VR and AR capabilities.
- **Debugging and Problem-Solving:** Identifying and resolving issues, such as broken 360-video playback and SteamVR hand tracking bugs.
- **Iterative Development:** Continuously improving projects based on feedback and testing.
- **Understanding Accessibility:** Ensuring VR experiences are inclusive and enjoyable for a diverse audience.
